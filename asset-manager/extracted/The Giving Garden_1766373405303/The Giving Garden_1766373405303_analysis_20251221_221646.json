Get it just right by laying out a hose to outline your bed. Once you have the perfect shape, mark the edges with a line of sand or flour.\n2.\tGet Rid Of Grass and Weeds\nIf you have grass growing in your new garden spot, dig it up with a spade or sod cutter. Or, if you have time to wait, mow that area as low as you can, then cover it with a several-sheet-thick layer of newspaper and several inches of soil or compost. Wait a couple of months for the grass to die.",

If you have poor soil, now's also a great time to incorporate organic matter, such as compost. Just dig it in while you work the ground.\n4.\tSite Your Plants \nThough it takes a little extra time, placing all your plants before you put them in the ground can make a world of difference. This allows you to get the spacing just right and make your plants really will look good next to each other.",

It's helpful to loosen or tease the plants' roots before you put them in the ground, especially if they were rootbound.\n6.\tSpread Mulch\nOther than amending the soil, the best thing you can do to keep your new garden healthy and low-maintenance is to spread mulch. A 2-inch-deep layer of shredded wood or other material will do wonders for stopping weeds and helping your soil conserve moisture during times of drought.",
